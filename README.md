# Lange und SÃ¶hne Website

With great nostalgia i look back at this project. It was the first big project I ever got to work on. This was a prototype i was working on for an agency to pitch the redesign of the customers website.

I got to choose the tech stack and had free-range over the development. (Which is very clear when you take a look at the code).
